    <h4>Description.</h4>
    The aloo poha or batata poha is quite well known in Gujarat and Maharashtra. It is known as batata poha where batata
    is “potato” and poha means “flattened rice”. Although this is a Gujarati version of aloo poha, the maharasthrian
    poha is usually made with onions. Hence they are called “kanda pohe” where kanda = onions in marathi language. Aloo
    poha is very popular breakfast dish in both these states and hence available in all local eatery in morning. The
    canteens in the offices also serve aloo poha in breakfast as well as in evening snacks. In my home we make aloo poha
    for evening snacks. Usually morning breakfast is bhakri or thepla.
